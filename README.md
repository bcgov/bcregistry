# BCRegistry

This project requires Node v16.x.x (npm v8.x.x). You can use Node Version manager (nvm) to manage several versions of node...
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install 16
```
...and then you can do `npm install` etc as below.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project

```
